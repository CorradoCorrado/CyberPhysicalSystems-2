Greetings fellow human. 
This repository is home to the projects developed during the second half of the Cyber Physical Systems class. 
You will find CAD documents, reports, BASH scripts, renders and other fun stuff to sink your teeth into. 
In this repository, every project has its own branch.

## Exploring Files 

You may take files and use them for reference, 
however explicit copies are strictly forbidden!

Usage is as follows: if you would like to explore the CAD file 
for an arbitrary device `ImaginaryDevice`, locate the parent branch 
`ImaginaryDevice CAD`and search for `ImaginaryDevice.sldprt`. 

Please adhere to this project's `code of conduct`.
